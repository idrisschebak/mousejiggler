Mouse Jiggler is a CLI App that moves your mouse cursor in an ever changing random pattern, keeping your computer active and helping to keep your cat entertained for hours. With adjustable parameters for distance, interval, threshold, and even a speedup probability, you can customize the movement of your mouse to fit your needs and maximize your cat's enjoyment.

### ‚ú® Features

- **Distance**: This parameter controls the maximum distance (in pixels) that the mouse cursor can move in any direction during each movement. Increasing this value will result in larger movements and a wider range of potential cursor locations.
- **Interval**: This parameter controls the duration of the pause (in seconds) between each movement of the mouse cursor. Decreasing this value will result in more frequent cursor movements and a busier mouse cursor.
- **Threshold**: This parameter determines the maximum distance (in pixels) that the mouse cursor can move before the loop is exited. If the cursor moves beyond this distance during a single movement, the loop will exit automatically. This can be used to detect manual movements of the mouse cursor and prevent interference with the automated movement pattern.
- **Speedup probability**: This parameter controls the probability that the mouse cursor will move with a higher speed than usual. When this parameter is set to a value greater than 0, the program will randomly choose a factor between 1.0 and 3.0 to increase the speed of the movement. This can be used to add some variability to the movement pattern and keep your cat more engaged.
